\begin{abstract}
Enterprise systems generate massive volumes of log data that require automated analysis for effective monitoring and security management. Traditional rule-based approaches suffer from high false positive rates and inability to adapt to evolving log patterns. This paper presents an AI-powered log analysis system leveraging BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for automated event detection and categorization. Our hybrid approach combines regex pattern matching, BERT-based semantic classification, and large language model fallback processing to achieve superior accuracy and real-time performance. The system demonstrates 88.9\% overall classification accuracy with perfect security alert detection (100\%) and excellent user action classification (93.3\%). We validated our approach on 145 real-world log entries across three datasets, including HDFS logs and synthetic enterprise data. The production-ready system processes 41 logs per second with sub-second response times, making it suitable for real-time cybersecurity monitoring. Key contributions include the novel three-tier hybrid architecture, comprehensive evaluation methodology, and demonstrated business impact through resolving critical misclassification issues. Our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches, achieving a 28.9\% improvement over baseline methods while maintaining a compact 184.9KB model size.

\section{Introduction}

Modern enterprise systems generate millions of log entries daily, creating an overwhelming challenge for IT operations and cybersecurity teams. These logs contain critical information about system behavior, user activities, security events, and potential anomalies that require immediate attention \cite{zhang2021deep}. However, the sheer volume and complexity of log data make manual analysis impractical, necessitating automated solutions for effective monitoring and threat detection.

Traditional log analysis approaches rely on rule-based systems and simple pattern matching techniques that struggle with the semantic complexity and evolving nature of modern log formats \cite{he2017drain}. These systems often produce high false positive rates, leading to alert fatigue among security analysts and potentially missing genuine security incidents. The dynamic nature of enterprise environments further complicates log analysis, as new applications, services, and attack vectors continuously emerge.

Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly transformer-based models like BERT \cite{devlin2018bert}, have opened new possibilities for intelligent log analysis. BERT's ability to understand contextual relationships and semantic meanings in text makes it particularly suitable for analyzing semi-structured log data. However, applying BERT directly to log analysis presents unique challenges, including the need for domain-specific adaptation, real-time processing requirements, and the structured nature of log formats.

The problem of automated log analysis encompasses several key challenges: (1) \textbf{Semantic Understanding}: Logs contain domain-specific terminology and structured formats that require specialized processing, (2) \textbf{Real-time Processing}: Enterprise systems require sub-second response times for critical security events, (3) \textbf{Scalability}: Systems must handle millions of log entries daily without performance degradation, (4) \textbf{Accuracy}: False positives and negatives have significant operational costs, and (5) \textbf{Adaptability}: Systems must adapt to new log formats and evolving attack patterns.

Our motivation stems from real-world challenges observed in enterprise environments, where existing log analysis systems frequently misclassify routine user activities as security threats. For instance, user login events being flagged as security alerts cause unnecessary investigations and resource allocation. This highlights the need for more sophisticated approaches that can distinguish between legitimate activities and genuine security concerns.

The primary objectives of this research are: (1) Develop a hybrid log analysis system combining rule-based and AI-powered approaches for optimal accuracy and performance, (2) Achieve superior classification accuracy while maintaining real-time processing capabilities, (3) Demonstrate the effectiveness of BERT-based approaches for log analysis through comprehensive evaluation, (4) Provide a production-ready solution that can be deployed in enterprise environments, and (5) Establish a framework for continuous improvement and adaptation to evolving log patterns.

\section{Related Works}

Log analysis has evolved significantly from simple pattern matching to sophisticated machine learning approaches. This section reviews key developments in automated log analysis, focusing on deep learning and transformer-based methods.

\subsection{Traditional Approaches}

Early log analysis systems relied on rule-based approaches and regular expressions for pattern matching. While effective for structured logs with known formats, these methods struggle with the semantic complexity of modern applications and require extensive manual rule creation and maintenance.

\subsection{Machine Learning Approaches}

DeepLog \cite{du2017deeplog} introduced deep learning to log analysis using LSTM networks for anomaly detection in system logs. The approach models log sequences as natural language and uses prediction errors to identify anomalies. While innovative, DeepLog requires significant training data and struggles with real-time processing requirements.

Drain \cite{he2017drain} proposed a streaming log parser that extracts templates from raw log messages using a fixed-depth tree structure. The method efficiently handles large-scale log streams but lacks semantic understanding capabilities for complex classification tasks.

Spell \cite{du2016spell} presents an online streaming approach for log parsing that incrementally learns log templates. The method addresses scalability concerns but provides limited semantic analysis capabilities for security event detection.

\subsection{Transformer-based Approaches}

LogBERT \cite{guo2021logbert} represents the first application of BERT to log anomaly detection, demonstrating the potential of transformer models for understanding log semantics. However, the approach focuses primarily on anomaly detection rather than comprehensive classification.

Recent surveys \cite{le2021survey} highlight the growing interest in deep learning approaches for log analysis while identifying key challenges in real-time processing, interpretability, and domain adaptation.

Table \ref{tab:related_work} compares existing approaches across key dimensions.

\section{Proposed Methodology}

Our proposed system employs a novel three-tier hybrid architecture that combines the efficiency of rule-based processing, the semantic understanding of BERT, and the reasoning capabilities of large language models. This approach optimizes both accuracy and processing speed while maintaining production-level performance requirements.

\subsection{System Architecture}

The hybrid architecture consists of three sequential processing stages, each designed to handle different types of log complexity while maintaining optimal resource utilization.

\textbf{Stage 1: Regex Pattern Matching} - This initial stage uses hand-crafted regular expressions to quickly classify logs with well-defined patterns. The stage handles 8-60\% of incoming logs depending on dataset characteristics and provides microsecond-level processing for structured entries like timestamps, IP addresses, and common error codes.

\textbf{Stage 2: BERT-based Semantic Classification} - The core processing engine employs a fine-tuned BERT model combined with SVM classification using TF-IDF features. This stage processes 30-74\% of logs that require semantic understanding and contextual analysis.

\textbf{Stage 3: LLM Fallback Processing} - Complex and ambiguous logs that cannot be classified by previous stages are processed using a large language model. This stage handles 2-10\% of logs, providing the highest quality reasoning for edge cases and novel patterns.

\subsection{Log Preprocessing and Normalization}

Raw log entries undergo systematic preprocessing to ensure consistent format and optimal feature extraction. The preprocessing pipeline includes:

\textbf{Before Normalization:}
\begin{verbatim}
2025-09-14 13:45:23.456 [INFO] User12345 
logged in from 192.168.1.100 via web 
interface - session_id: abc123xyz
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{After Normalization:}
\begin{verbatim}
User <USER_ID> logged in from <IP_ADDR> 
via <INTERFACE> session_id <SESSION_ID>
\end{verbatim}

This normalization process preserves semantic meaning while reducing vocabulary size and improving model generalization.

\subsection{Mathematical Representation}

The BERT embedding representation for log message $L$ is computed as:

\begin{equation}
E(L) = \text{BERT}(\text{[CLS]} + L + \text{[SEP]})
\end{equation}

where $E(L) \in \mathbb{R}^{768}$ represents the contextualized embedding vector.

The classification loss function uses cross-entropy:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{c=1}^{C} y_{i,c} \log(\hat{y}_{i,c})
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the number of samples, $C$ is the number of classes, $y_{i,c}$ is the true label, and $\hat{y}_{i,c}$ is the predicted probability.

\subsection{Anomaly Detection Algorithm}

The following pseudocode outlines our anomaly detection process:

\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE \textbf{Input:} Log message $L$, threshold $\tau$
\STATE \textbf{Output:} Classification result and confidence score
\STATE
\STATE $patterns \leftarrow \text{extract\_regex\_patterns}(L)$
\IF{$patterns \neq \emptyset$}
    \RETURN $\text{classify\_by\_regex}(patterns)$
\ENDIF
\STATE
\STATE $embedding \leftarrow \text{BERT}(L)$
\STATE $confidence \leftarrow \text{SVM\_predict}(embedding)$
\IF{$confidence > \tau$}
    \RETURN $\text{SVM\_classification}(embedding)$
\ELSE
    \RETURN $\text{LLM\_fallback}(L)$
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
