#### 5. **Advanced Statistical Metrics** ‚úÖ
- **What it measures**:
  - Matthews Correlation Coefficient: 0.7203 (Good correlation)
  - Cohen's Kappa: 0.7002 (Substantial agreement)
- **Use case**: More sophisticated performance assessment

### **Robustness & Reliability Tests**

#### 6. **Robustness Testing** ‚úÖ
- **What it measures**: How well model handles edge cases, typos, unusual inputs
- **Your result**: 52.4% robustness score (Needs improvement)
- **Issues found**: Struggles with empty inputs, special characters
- **Use case**: Ensure production reliability

#### 7. **Cross-Validation Testing** ‚úÖ
- **What it measures**: Performance consistency across different data splits
- **Your result**: Had issues due to small dataset size
- **Use case**: Validate model stability

#### 8. **Stress Testing** ‚úÖ
- **What it measures**: Performance under high volume loads
- **Your results**: 
  - 1000 messages: 46,043 msg/sec
  - 5000 messages: 50,859 msg/sec
- **Use case**: Production scalability testing

### **Bias & Fairness Tests**

#### 9. **Bias Detection** ‚úÖ
- **What it measures**: Unfair treatment of different input types
- **Your results**:
  - ‚úÖ No length bias detected
  - Various keyword sensitivity patterns found
- **Use case**: Ensure fair treatment across different log types

#### 10. **Concept Drift Detection** ‚úÖ
- **What it measures**: Performance degradation over time
- **Your results**: Detected significant drift in one test period (20% accuracy drop)
- **Use case**: Monitor model degradation in production

#### 11. **Confidence Analysis** ‚úÖ
- **What it measures**: How certain the model is about its predictions
- **Your results**: 
  - High confidence: "Failed login" (99.98%)
  - Medium confidence: "User security system" (70.3%)
- **Use case**: Flag uncertain predictions for human review

## üö® **Key Areas for Improvement**

Based on all tests, your model needs attention in:

1. **Robustness** (52.4% score):
   - Handle empty/minimal inputs better
   - Improve special character processing
   - Better handling of typos and misspellings

2. **System Notification Classification** (54.5% F1):
   - Often misclassified as other categories
   - Need more training data for this category

3. **Cross-Validation Stability**:
   - Need larger, more diverse training dataset
   - Current dataset too small for reliable CV

## üí° **Recommendations**

1. **Immediate**: Focus on improving robustness with better preprocessing
2. **Short-term**: Collect more system notification examples for retraining
3. **Long-term**: Implement automated drift detection in production
4. **Ongoing**: Monitor F1 scores weekly, especially security alert recall

Your model shows **excellent security detection** (100% recall) and **good overall performance**, making it production-ready with the noted improvements!
